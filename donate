Consider a donation to support my work!
I'm not greedy or something but donations arе scarce and for all these years are bellow $300. I can't keep going like that. I'm wasting a lot of time and electricity FOR YOU and I also have a life, a wife, work and personal things to care of. I'm not a release group, I'm a single guy and it reqires a lot of efforts every single day.
Thank you!
